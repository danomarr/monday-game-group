In the fall of 2015 a bunch of guys sat down around a kitchen table in Solna, Sweden playing Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition. Little did we know of the adventure we were about to embark on and the things we were about to learn. Both in and out of game.

This wiki is dedicated to remembering what we have seen and experienced, the decisions we have made and why we made them, and the change we have gone through from the time we all went to prison to the present.
