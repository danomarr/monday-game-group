It all began in a small town I've forgotten the name of. We where a mixed assortment of a murderous drow that got us kicked into jail, a stuttering wood elf that was apparently raised by wolves, a high elf rogue that was beside himself for being associated with such common people, a nimble and lightning quick wood elf monk that had for, at that point, unknown reasons left her temple, an exceptionally moody drow that was quick to impulsive decisions, and a very old hermit wood elf druid that definitely hadn't seen civilization in a good long while.

This was us. This is still us, in many ways, although I like to think we might have grown. But to begin in the beginning the murderous drow paladin Kaladan Brood got us all thrown in jail after slaughtering a farmstead just outside of the town of which name I still cannot remember.
