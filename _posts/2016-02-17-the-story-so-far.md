It all began in a small town I've forgotten the name of. We were a mixed assortment of adventurers smashed together by the occurrence of death and despair.

 A band comprised out of the murderous drow that got us kicked into jail, a stuttering wood elf that was apparently raised by wolves, a high elf rogue that was beside himself for being associated with such common people, a nimble and lightning quick wood elf monk that had for, at that point, unknown reasons left her temple, an exceptionally moody drow that was quick to impulsive decisions, and a very old hermit wood elf druid that definitely hadn't seen civilization in a good long while.

This was us. This is still us, in many ways, although I like to think we might have grown. But to begin in the beginning the murderous drow paladin Kaladan Brood got us all thrown in jail after slaughtering a farmstead just outside of the town of which name I still cannot remember. As most of the party put all their efforts into making a hasty escape the paladin was contacted by an incorporeal voice from the beyond promising a swift release from our imprisonment. We did not take this offer. Instead we faced judgement by the towns mayor, a pale, obese, and seemingly evil man, and his muscle Garrok who might be one of the scariest people alive with his floating magical sword and mind penetrating magic.

In the end we were presented with a choice. Die or head to an underground temple a days travel away and pick the fruit of the Giltheas tree.
